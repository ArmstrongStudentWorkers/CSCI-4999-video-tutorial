                        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                        <p>Welcome folks! We made this little website to give you some tips to help you make thirty second to one minute videos
                        that are clear, concise, fun, and effective. It's important to make sure your video is exciting and engaging, while still
                        communicating your message. Just remember that making a video is more than narrarating a PowerPoint-style slideshow.
                        You want to make sure you take full advantage of all the additional tools that videos offer. Don't worry, we'll show you
                        how to do all this and more.</p>
                    
                        <p>There are three units to work through that are outlined below. Mostly, "working through" them involves watching videos
                        and occasionally reading a short article or two. All in all, it's fast, it's quasi-fun, and it's definitely worth
                        checking out. Enjoy!</p>
