                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
			
                        <p>Welcome folks! We made this little website to give you some tips to help you make thirty second to one minute videos
                        that are clear, concise, fun, and effective. It's important to make sure your video is exciting and engaging, while still
                        communicating your message. Just remember that making a video is more than narrarating a PowerPoint-style slideshow.
                        You want to make sure you take full advantage of all the additional tools that videos offer. Don't worry, we'll show you
                        how to do all this and more.</p>

			    <p>Before we get started in earnest, we want to take a moment to introduce ourselves and issue a quick caveat. We are both seniors majoring in computer science.
			    We know what it's like to read a lot of boring text, so we tried to fill this website with videos and short easy to read articles (we also filled it
			    with some typos too - you're welcome).
			    Here's the caveat: The style of this website is extrememly informal. This was an intentional choice to try and make the site feel accessible to our
			    peers. Your class presentations will likely need to make use of a much more formal style. That is to say, don't copy us; we're not doing it right.
			    Now on to the good stuff!</p>

			<p>There are three units to work through that are outlined below. Mostly, "working through" them involves watching videos
                        and occasionally reading a short article or two. All in all, it's fast, it's quasi-fun, and it's definitely worth
                        checking out. Enjoy!</p>

                    <h3>Software</h3>
                    <p class="subsection">This unit lists several software options that may help you to make your thirty second videos.
                    Some of the software is specific to the Windows or Mac platform, but we've given you some platform
                    agnostic options as well.</p>
