                        <p>Welcome to Unit 1! Below we've given you a plethora of tools to use in your quest to make the worlds most awesomest
			video. Some of the software is specific to the Windows or Mac platform, but we've given you some platform
			agnostic options as well. While this list is far from exhaustive, all the software shown is free or has a free trial
			period, and it's sure to get your creative juices flowing</p>
			<p>Keep in mind as you look through these options, that the best video might be made by combining tools. You may want to edit
			your video and create a theme and add a soundtrack with one software, while another is better suited for voice overs and adding
			text or effects.</p>
