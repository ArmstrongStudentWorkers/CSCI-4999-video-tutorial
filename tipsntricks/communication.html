                        <p>
                            This is a quick one! We're not going to bog you down with videos here, we just want to remind you of some basic communication guidlines.
			    Some of these tips are cleary directed towards live presentations, but they are good things to keep in mind when planning your video.
                        </p>
			 <ul>
                            <li>Rehearse!</li>
			    <li>Think about your audience when planning your communication style. An in class presentation generally needs to be formal. This website is
			    intentionally informal because we are offering our peers informal advice.</li>
                            <li>Remember to speak clearly.</li>
                            <li>As a rule: face and look at your audience. Look away from them to call attention to something important to your presentation.
			    A pause and look-away can call attention to something you've just said.</li>
                            <li>Don't grab hold of yourself or do anything to make yourself look smaller from the audience's perspective.
			    Make yourself look larger if you can do so in a not-distracting, not-to-deliberate-looking way.</li>
                            <li>If you ever think you're speaking or moving too slowly: move and speak slower.</li>
                        </ul>
