                        <p>
                            Let's take a minute to recap (or cover for the first time if you didn't read the article) the most important points; keep these ideas in mind
                            while making your video:
                        </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a shot list (you may even want to storyboard your whole film before you start).</li>
                            <li>Stabalize the camera.</li>
                            <li>Record 3 seconds of pre-roll and post-roll to make editing easier.</li>
                            <li>Beware of "cool" looking transitions like slide, clock-wipe, and page turn.</li>
                            <li>Film tight. This means filling the frame with people, faces, or action.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
