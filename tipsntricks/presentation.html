                        <p>Let's start this off with a short article by Purdue University on <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/learning/blog/?p=6696">creating an instructional
                        video.</a> While your videos may not be in this exact genre, a lot of the tips still apply.</p>
                        
                         <p>Here are the key take-aways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Define the video purpose before you start.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the audio is clear.</li>
                            <li>Make sure the script is focused.</li>
                            <li>Always show what you are talking about.</li>

			<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2013/06/11/ten-presentation-techniques-you-can-and-should-copy-from-apples-wwdc-keynote/">
			copying on of Apple's keynote presentations.</a> When in doubt always copy the professionals. While the tips are geared towards live presentations,
			a lot of the concepts translate weel to video.</p>
			    
			     <p>Here are some of the key take-aways:</p>
			    <ul>
			        <li>Practice. A lot.</li>
			        <li>Stick to one theme per slide (or in your case per scene).</li>
			        <li>Make data visual. Avoid using too many words or bullet points.</li>
			    </ul>
		    </div>
		    
		    <p>And lastly, a few additional pointers from our experience:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Storyboard your video and put the verbal component down in writing before you actually start recording.</li>
			    <li>Don't be afraid to do a lot of takes. It can make up for a lack of rehearsal.</li>
			    <li>If you're copying video files around your computer, make sure to watch your video after each copy to see if its quality has degraded.</li>
			    <li>Keep your video separated  into small components until you're ready to publish.
			    This makes it easy to do a lot of takes and makes video files more transportable around your computer.</li>
			    <li>Be able to clearly describe your video in a few keywords so you can set good tags in Youtube.</li>
			    <li>Have fun! It comes across to the viewers.</li>
