                        <h2>For the Mac Movie Makers</h2>
                        <p>We've focused pretty heavily on iMovie here. iMovie comes preinstalled on your Mac, it's free, and it's easy to use. It
			also makes editing soundtracks and syncing them up with your film as easy as editing your video. Below that we've listed some additional
			software available from the app store. We've also included a couple iphone apps for those of you who want to film and edit your video all
			in one place.</p>

                        <h3>Everything You Need to Know About iMovie</h3>
                        <p>iMovie has pretty much everything you need to make your basic amateur film. Just beware of overusing the sound effects or transitions -
			remember restraint is key. We've got two options for you here for tutorials:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZcfLjecyCc" target="_blank">
			The comprehensive tutorial</a> is about a half an hour. It's kind of long (I highly recommend watching it at double speed), but it covers a lot
			of great features and will help you elevate your film editing. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J79_0h3ozS0" target="_blank">
			The quick and dirty tutorial</a> teaches you all the basics in about five minutes. </p>

                    <h3>Other Options</h3>
                    <p> Below are a few additional optons available for iOS and OSx. Some of these are strong and powerful, while others will need to be used in
		    conjunction with other tools like iMovie. Try them out and see what you think.
