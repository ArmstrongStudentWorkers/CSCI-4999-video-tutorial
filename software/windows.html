                        <h2>For the Windows Folks</h2>
			<p>We have tthree tutorials selected here. The first is a quick run down of the entire movie making process on a PC. The second two take
			a more indepth look at Serif Movie Plus, one of the software options featured in the first video.</p>
			
			 <p>Just an FYI, Serif Movie PLus  has a free and a super pricey version, so make sure you search for 'Free Serif Movie Plus'. It's a really powerful
			Windows-only tool.</p>

			<h3>From Start to Finish on a PC</h3>
                        <p>Here's a short video teaching you how to make your super short video. This quick tutorial takes you from begining to uploading your video on youTube.
			It highlights the basic functionality of Windows Live Movie Maker, then moves on to more advanced functionality with Serif Movie Plus, and
			finally uploading the video to YouTube. It also makes use of free screen capture software like <a href="http://tinytake.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Take</a>,
			which can really come in handy when making informative videos.

			<h3>Serif Movie Plus Starter Edition</h3>
                        <p>This first tutorial covers cropping. This is one of the best features that Serif Movie Plus has to offer, especially for newbies in the film
			making world. New film makers often film from too wide an angle, losing the drama and detail of a full frame. Check out the tutorial below to get a
			very detailed tutorial on using this powerful tool.

			<p>This second tutorial shows you how to use a tool strongly featured in the overview video, putting a still image or second vieo inside your video.
			Depending on the style of your film, this may or may not be useful for you. Even if you don't plan on embedding a video in your video, check out
			the tutorial because it can help with overlaying audio too.
