                        <h2>Software For (almost) Everyone</h2>
                        <p>Below are a handful of video editing softwares that are either online services or are available for download
                        on a variety of systems. Like the examples in the previous two sections, each of these has strengths and weaknesses and you
                        may end up using two or three of them on your video before you're finished.</p>
                    
                        <p>Below each description is a video that was created with the software.</p>

                        <h3>Powtoons</h3>
                        <p>Powtoons is free. There is a paid version that adds a few more themes, but the free version offers a fair number of themes
                        in its own right. It's basically a quick and easy animation creator. There's virtually no learning curve, and you can make a
                        basic animated short in under a half an hour. The only glaring drawback is that, while you can upload a voice over, it doesn't
                        allow you the control (like cutting sections of the soundtrack to match up with the video) that you'll find with programs like
                        iVideo. Check them out at their <a href="http://www.powtoon.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Camtasia</h3>
                        <p>Camtasia is the only non-online option on this page. It has to be downloaded but it has both a Windows and Mac version
                        (sorry linux users). It's far from free, but it does have a free thirty day trial. It was originally intended for animating
                        PowerPoint-style slideshows, but it translates well to video editing. It's strong points are frame freezing and adding
                        text and graphics like arrows to an existing video. In the video below, you'll see these features in action in a rugby
                        highlights reel. Check them out at their <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

                        <h3>WeVideo</h3>
                        <p>WeVideo is another online video editor. They too have a free and paid version. The paid version is only about six dollars
                        per month. The paid version may well be worth the dough given the extremely limited export options and monthly export time
                        in the free version. All that said, it has a super clean interface and is easy to use. It also offers a variety of themes and
                        effect options. Check them out at their <a href="https://www.wevideo.com/overview" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Animoto</h3>
                        <p>Animoto is an online video editing tool. It has a free version and a paid version, but the paid version is only around five
                        dollars per month, so it might be worth purchasing if you only need it for a month or two. The free version is limited to thirty
                        seconds of video and has limited style options. So here's the skinny: Animoto has awesome built in style options and a large bank
                        of soundtracks which can make your video look super professional in short order. It's really best suited for creating
                        animated picture collages, but you can use it for more traditional videos too as you'll see in the clip below. Check them out at
                        their <a href="http://animoto.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
