                        <h2>Short Videos</h2>
                        <p>Below is a list of chort clips to inspire you. Unfortunately, you'll have to watch an advertisement before a few of these (sorry!). They are
                        mostly around thirty seconds in length, but a few are longer. We picked the longer one because they have concepts that translate well to shorter
                        videos.</p>
                    
                        <p>Above each clip we pointed out a few good (and occasionally some bad) points to look out for as you watch, but don't feel limited to our point
                        of view. Watch closely and judge for yourself what works and what doesn't.</p>

                        <h3>30 Seconds to Know</h3>
                        <p>NBC News has an awesome segment called <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/30-seconds-to-know">30 Seconds to Know</a>. It's a large collection
                        of informative videos that (excluding the roughly ten second intro) are thirty seconds long. We've picked one to show you, but there are hundreds more on
                        their website if you need more inspiration. As you're watching, pay attention to how clearly and concisely the expert relays the information.
                        Also notice that, while they use text and effects to enhance the video and emphasize certain points, they don't over do it and lose focus. When making
                        your video, keep in mind this balancing act between using enough effects to keep a viewers attention and few enough effects to not distract from
                        the main point.</p>

                        <h3>The Oscar Experience</h3>
                        <p>This clip is fun because it was actually made by a college student like you. It was made for a comptetition called the Oscar Experience and
                        if you YouTube that term, you'll find a lot more thirty second examples. Notice how Evan has a sound track playing behing the voice-over which
                        really adds depth and a touch of professionalism. Also, notice that, while he has a lot of words on the screen, they are short simple terms that
                        are easy to read and understand quickly. Imagine how overwhelming this might feel if he had whole sentences instead of key terms displaying.</p>

                        <h3>Runaway CEO Pay</h3>
                        <p>This is another thirty second clip. It's super clean and simple but expresses a powerful point in an equally powerful way. While watching it,
                        pay attention to the way the animation is used to really accentuate the point. Notice the use of dramatic pauses that build anticipation, for
                        example the pause between the initial statement and when "1965" appears and the pause before the pan out on the second group of workers. Again notice
                        the brevity of the sentences and how they are simple and incorporate clear stats and numbers. </p>
